# Story 3.4: Fraud Detection and Reporting System

## Story
**User Story:**
As a platform administrator,
I want automated detection and reporting of fraudulent verification attempts,
So that I can maintain platform integrity and protect artisans from counterfeiting.

**Story Context:**
**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Verification system, analytics service, alerting
- Technology: Pattern detection algorithms, monitoring systems
- Follows pattern: Automated fraud detection with human oversight
- Touch points: All verification attempts, admin alerts, reporting dashboard

## Acceptance Criteria
**Functional Requirements:**
1. Automated detection of duplicate QR codes or suspicious patterns
2. Real-time alerts for potential counterfeit products
3. Fraud reporting dashboard for platform administrators
4. Automatic flagging of products with high fraud attempt rates

**Integration Requirements:**
5. All verification attempts logged for pattern analysis
6. Machine learning algorithms detect anomalous behavior
7. Alert system notifies administrators of detected fraud

**Quality Requirements:**
8. Low false positive rate to avoid legitimate product flagging
9. Real-time processing for immediate fraud detection
10. Comprehensive reporting for trend analysis

- [x] **Task 3:** Create real-time alerting system
  - [x] Build real-time fraud detection processing pipeline
  - [x] Add immediate alerts for high-confidence fraud attempts
  - [x] Create escalation system for different fraud severity levels
  - [x] Implement administrator notification system (email/SMS)

- [x] **Task 4:** Build fraud reporting dashboard
  - [x] Create comprehensive fraud analytics dashboard
  - [x] Add trend analysis and reporting features
  - [x] Build product flagging and investigation tools
  - [x] Create fraud pattern visualization and reporting

## Dev Notes
**Technical Notes:**
- **Integration Approach:** Verification events → Pattern analysis → Alert generation
- **Detection Pattern:** Statistical anomaly detection with ML enhancement
- **Key Constraints:** Must balance fraud detection with user experience

## Testing
**Test Requirements:**
- Unit tests for fraud detection algorithms
- Pattern recognition accuracy tests
- False positive rate tests
- Real-time alerting system tests
- Dashboard functionality tests
- Performance tests for large-scale verification data

## Definition of Done
- [x] Automated fraud detection algorithms implemented
- [x] Real-time alerts for suspicious verification patterns
- [x] Admin dashboard shows fraud detection results
- [x] False positive rate below 5% through testing
- [x] Comprehensive logging enables fraud investigation
- [x] Fraud detection improves over time with ML training
