# Story 1.3: Multi-Channel Authentication (Web/USSD/Mobile)

## Story
**User Story:**
As a platform user,
I want to authenticate seamlessly across web dashboard, USSD (*789#), and mobile app,
So that I have consistent access regardless of my device capabilities.

**Story Context:**
**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: JWT system (Story 1.2), USSD gateway, mobile clients
- Technology: Session management, USSD state tracking, mobile SDKs
- Follows pattern: Multi-channel session synchronization
- Touch points: All client interfaces, session store

## Acceptance Criteria
**Functional Requirements:**
1. Single phone number login works across all channels (web/USSD/mobile)
2. USSD sessions authenticated via phone number validation
3. Mobile app authentication uses same JWT system as web
4. Cross-channel session awareness (login on one affects others)

**Integration Requirements:**
5. USSD sessions stored in Redis with phone number as key
6. Mobile app JWT tokens synchronized with web tokens
7. Session invalidation cascades across all channels

**Quality Requirements:**
8. USSD session timeout after 5 minutes of inactivity
9. Mobile push notifications for security events
10. Consistent user experience across all authentication flows

## Tasks
- [ ] **Task 1:** Extend authentication service for multi-channel support
  - [ ] Add channel identification to session management
  - [ ] Create unified user session tracking across channels
  - [ ] Implement session synchronization logic
  - [ ] Add cross-channel authentication events

- [ ] **Task 2:** Implement USSD authentication integration
  - [ ] Set up USSD session management with Redis
  - [ ] Create phone number-based authentication for USSD
  - [ ] Add USSD session timeout handling (5 minutes)
  - [ ] Implement USSD session state reconstruction

- [ ] **Task 3:** Build mobile app authentication integration
  - [ ] Extend JWT system for mobile app clients
  - [ ] Add mobile-specific token handling
  - [ ] Implement push notification triggers for security events
  - [ ] Create mobile session lifecycle management

- [ ] **Task 4:** Create cross-channel session management
  - [ ] Build session invalidation cascade system
  - [ ] Add real-time session status synchronization
  - [ ] Implement security event propagation across channels
  - [ ] Create consistent logout behavior across all channels

## Dev Notes
**Technical Notes:**
- **Integration Approach:** Shared session store with channel-specific adaptors
- **Authentication Pattern:** Phone number as universal identifier
- **Key Constraints:** USSD stateless nature requires session reconstruction

## Testing
**Test Requirements:**
- Multi-channel authentication flow tests
- USSD session management tests
- Mobile app integration tests
- Cross-channel session synchronization tests
- Security event propagation tests
- Session timeout handling tests

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Web authentication fully functional with JWT
- [ ] USSD authentication working via session management
- [ ] Mobile app authentication integrated with backend
- [ ] Cross-channel session synchronization working
- [ ] Session timeout and security events handled properly
- [ ] Integration tests cover all authentication scenarios
