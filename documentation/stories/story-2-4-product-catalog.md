# Story 2.4: Product Catalog with Search and Filtering

## Story
**User Story:**
As a consumer browsing for authentic African crafts,
I want to search and filter the product catalog by category, location, and price,
So that I can discover products that match my interests and budget.

**Story Context:**
**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Product database, search indexing, web frontend
- Technology: Database indexing, search algorithms, React Query
- Follows pattern: Paginated search with filters
- Touch points: Product API, frontend catalog, mobile browsing

## Acceptance Criteria
**Functional Requirements:**
1. Product catalog displays all verified products with images and details
2. Search functionality works across product names and descriptions
3. Filtering by category (woodwork, textiles, pottery, jewelry, metalwork)
4. Location-based filtering by artisan county/region

**Integration Requirements:**
5. Database indexing optimizes search performance
6. API pagination handles large product catalogs efficiently
7. Frontend state management maintains filter selections

**Quality Requirements:**
8. Search results display within 2 seconds
9. Infinite scroll or pagination for smooth browsing experience
10. Mobile-responsive catalog interface
