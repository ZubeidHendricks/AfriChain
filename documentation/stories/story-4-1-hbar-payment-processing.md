# Story 4.1: HBAR Payment Request and Processing

## Story
**User Story:**
As a consumer who wants to purchase an authentic product,
I want to pay using HBAR cryptocurrency,
So that I can make secure, borderless payments without traditional banking limitations.

**Story Context:**
**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Product catalog, Hedera SDK, payment processing
- Technology: Hedera payment transactions, wallet integration
- Follows pattern: Crypto payment request and confirmation
- Touch points: Product purchase flow, Hedera network, payment confirmation

## Acceptance Criteria
**Functional Requirements:**
1. Purchase button generates HBAR payment request with exact amount
2. Payment request includes recipient account and memo for identification
3. Real-time monitoring of payment transaction status
4. Payment confirmation triggers order processing

**Integration Requirements:**
5. Hedera SDK integration for payment transaction creation
6. Payment monitoring via transaction status polling
7. Database recording of all payment attempts and confirmations

**Quality Requirements:**
8. Payment amounts calculated with current HBAR exchange rates
9. Transaction confirmation within 5 seconds typical, 30 seconds maximum
10. Clear payment instructions and status updates for users
