# Story 2.3: QR Code Generation for Product Verification

## Story
**User Story:**
As an artisan with an NFT-certified product,
I want a unique QR code for my product,
So that customers can instantly verify authenticity using their mobile devices.

**Story Context:**
**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: NFT minting (Story 2.2), QR code libraries, product display
- Technology: QR code generation libraries, cryptographic signatures
- Follows pattern: Signed verification tokens
- Touch points: Product pages, printable certificates, QR scanning

## Acceptance Criteria
**Functional Requirements:**
1. Unique QR code generated for each NFT-minted product
2. QR code contains product ID and cryptographic verification data
3. QR code downloadable as high-resolution PNG for printing
4. QR code scannable by standard mobile camera apps

**Integration Requirements:**
5. QR generation triggered after successful NFT minting
6. Verification data includes HMAC signature for tamper detection
7. TiDB stores QR code data linked to product and NFT records

**Quality Requirements:**
8. QR codes work reliably with various mobile camera apps
9. High contrast and resolution suitable for printing on certificates
10. Verification data expires appropriately to prevent replay attacks

## Tasks
- [x] **Task 1:** Set up QR code generation service
  - [x] Install QR code generation library (qrcode npm package)
  - [x] Create QR code generation service with customizable options
  - [x] Set up high-resolution PNG output (300 DPI minimum)
  - [x] Add error correction level configuration for reliability

- [x] **Task 2:** Implement verification data payload creation
  - [x] Create signed verification payload with product ID and NFT data
  - [x] Add HMAC signature generation using secret key
  - [x] Include timestamp for verification data expiry
  - [x] Create URL-safe base64 encoding for QR data

- [x] **Task 3:** Build QR code generation workflow
  - [x] Create automatic QR generation trigger after NFT minting success
  - [x] Generate verification URL with encoded payload
  - [x] Create downloadable QR code endpoint for artisans
  - [x] Add QR code data storage linked to product records

- [x] **Task 4:** Create QR code API endpoints and product integration
  - [x] Create comprehensive QR code REST API endpoints
  - [x] Add QR code generation endpoints for products and NFTs
  - [x] Implement QR code verification and validation endpoints
  - [x] Add analytics and tracking endpoints for QR code usage
  - [x] Create batch operations for multiple QR code generation
  - [x] Integrate QR code routes into main application router
  - [x] Add comprehensive error handling and validation

## Dev Notes
**Technical Notes:**
- **Integration Approach:** NFT success → Generate signed payload → Create QR code
- **Security Pattern:** HMAC-signed verification data with timestamp
- **Key Constraints:** QR code must be scannable even when printed on physical certificates

## Testing
**Test Requirements:**
- Unit tests for QR code generation and payload creation
- HMAC signature validation tests
- QR code readability tests with various mobile devices
- High-resolution output quality tests
- Certificate printing compatibility tests
- End-to-end QR generation workflow tests

## Definition of Done
- [ ] QR codes generated automatically after NFT minting
- [ ] QR codes contain tamper-proof verification data
- [ ] High-resolution QR codes suitable for printing
- [ ] QR codes scannable by mobile cameras and apps
- [ ] Verification payload includes all necessary authentication data
- [ ] QR generation integrated into product management workflow

### Completion Notes
Story 2.3 Task 4 has been successfully completed. Created comprehensive QR code API endpoints that integrate with the existing QR code services (Tasks 1-3). The implementation includes:

1. **Generation Endpoints**: Product QR, NFT QR, Custom QR, and Batch generation
2. **Verification Endpoints**: Complete QR verification with blockchain integration
3. **Analytics Endpoints**: Detailed tracking and reporting capabilities  
4. **Management Endpoints**: Templates, configuration, and utility endpoints
5. **Full Integration**: Mounted routes in main app with comprehensive API documentation

All endpoints follow established patterns from the existing codebase with proper authentication, validation, and error handling.

### File List
**Created Files:**
- `/home/zubeid/hedara/backend/auth-service/src/routes/qrCodeRoutes.ts` - Complete QR code API endpoints (1,122 lines)
