# Story 4.3: Real-time Exchange Rate and Conversion

## Story
**User Story:**
As a platform user involved in crypto-to-mobile money transactions,
I want accurate, real-time exchange rate calculations,
So that I pay fair prices and artisans receive appropriate compensation.

**Story Context:**
**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Payment processing, exchange rate APIs, pricing display
- Technology: CoinGecko API, ExchangeRate-API, rate caching
- Follows pattern: Real-time rate fetching with caching
- Touch points: Product pricing, payment calculations, settlement amounts

## Acceptance Criteria
**Functional Requirements:**
1. Real-time HBAR to USD and USD to KES exchange rates
2. Rate updates every 60 seconds during active trading hours
3. Rate caching prevents excessive API calls
4. Transparent rate display during checkout process

**Integration Requirements:**
5. CoinGecko API integration for HBAR pricing
6. ExchangeRate-API integration for USD to KES rates
7. Redis caching of rates with automatic expiry

**Quality Requirements:**
8. Rate fetching handles API failures gracefully
9. Fallback to cached rates if APIs unavailable
10. Rate calculation accuracy to 4 decimal places

## Tasks
- [ ] **Task 1:** Set up exchange rate API integrations
  - [ ] Configure CoinGecko API for HBAR to USD rates
  - [ ] Set up ExchangeRate-API for USD to KES conversion
  - [ ] Add API key management and rate limiting
  - [ ] Create fallback rate sources for redundancy

- [ ] **Task 2:** Implement rate caching system
  - [ ] Set up Redis caching for exchange rates
  - [ ] Add automatic cache expiry (60 seconds)
  - [ ] Create cache warming system for popular rates
  - [ ] Implement cache invalidation strategies

- [ ] **Task 3:** Build rate calculation service
  - [ ] Create HBAR to KES conversion calculation service
  - [ ] Add rate calculation accuracy (4 decimal places)
  - [ ] Implement rate history tracking for analytics
  - [ ] Create rate change alerts for significant movements

- [ ] **Task 4:** Add rate display and transparency features
  - [ ] Build real-time rate display in product pricing
  - [ ] Add rate transparency in checkout process
  - [ ] Create rate update notifications for users
  - [ ] Implement historical rate charts for reference

## Dev Notes
**Technical Notes:**
- **Integration Approach:** Scheduled rate updates → Cache storage → Real-time retrieval
- **Caching Pattern:** TTL-based rate caching with API fallbacks
- **Key Constraints:** API rate limits require efficient caching strategy

## Testing
**Test Requirements:**
- Unit tests for rate calculation accuracy
- Integration tests for exchange rate APIs
- Cache performance and expiry tests
- Fallback system tests during API outages
- Rate calculation precision tests
- Load tests for high-volume rate requests

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Real-time exchange rates integrated from multiple APIs
- [ ] Rate caching reduces API calls while maintaining accuracy
- [ ] Fallback handling ensures system availability during API outages
- [ ] Transparent rate display in user interfaces
- [ ] Rate calculation accuracy tested against manual calculations
- [ ] Exchange rate system tested with various market conditions
