# Story 1.2: JWT Token Management and Session Handling

## Story
**User Story:**
As an authenticated platform user,
I want secure, persistent sessions across web and mobile interfaces,
So that I don't need to re-authenticate frequently while maintaining security.

**Story Context:**
**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: User registration system (Story 1.1 dependency)
- Technology: JWT libraries, Redis, Express middleware
- Follows pattern: OAuth 2.0-style token management
- Touch points: API gateway, all protected endpoints

## Acceptance Criteria
**Functional Requirements:**
1. JWT access tokens issued with 15-minute expiration
2. Refresh tokens issued with 7-day expiration and rotation
3. Token-based API authentication for all protected endpoints
4. Automatic token refresh before expiration

**Integration Requirements:**
5. JWT middleware validates all API requests
6. Redis stores refresh tokens with automatic expiry
7. Token blacklisting on logout prevents reuse

**Quality Requirements:**
8. Tokens include user ID, phone number, and permissions
9. Secure HTTP-only cookies for web clients
10. Token validation handles edge cases (expired, malformed, revoked)

## Tasks
- [ ] **Task 1:** Set up JWT token generation and validation
  - [ ] Install and configure JWT libraries (jsonwebtoken, express-jwt)
  - [ ] Create JWT service with RS256 asymmetric signing
  - [ ] Implement access token generation (15-minute expiry)
  - [ ] Add refresh token generation (7-day expiry with rotation)

- [ ] **Task 2:** Build JWT middleware for API protection
  - [ ] Create JWT validation middleware for Express routes
  - [ ] Add token extraction from Authorization header and cookies
  - [ ] Implement token blacklisting check against Redis
  - [ ] Add error handling for expired, malformed, and missing tokens

- [ ] **Task 3:** Implement refresh token system
  - [ ] Create refresh token endpoint with automatic rotation
  - [ ] Add Redis storage for refresh tokens with TTL
  - [ ] Implement secure refresh token validation
  - [ ] Add logout functionality with token blacklisting

- [ ] **Task 4:** Create session management across channels
  - [ ] Add HTTP-only cookie support for web clients
  - [ ] Implement token payload with user ID, phone, permissions
  - [ ] Create session validation for concurrent device access
  - [ ] Add token revocation for security events

## Dev Notes
**Technical Notes:**
- **Integration Approach:** Express middleware with JWT validation per request
- **Security Pattern:** RS256 asymmetric signing with rotating keys
- **Key Constraints:** Must support concurrent sessions across devices

## Testing
**Test Requirements:**
- Unit tests for token generation and validation
- Integration tests for JWT middleware
- Refresh token rotation tests
- Token blacklisting tests
- Concurrent session tests
- Security tests for token manipulation attempts

## Definition of Done
- [ ] JWT tokens generated with proper claims and expiration
- [ ] Refresh token rotation working automatically
- [ ] API middleware validates all protected routes
- [ ] Token blacklisting prevents replay attacks
- [ ] Session management works across web and mobile
- [ ] Security tests cover token manipulation attempts
