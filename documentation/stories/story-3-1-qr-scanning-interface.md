# Story 3.1: QR Code Scanning Interface (Web/Mobile)

## Story
**User Story:**
As a consumer with a product to verify,
I want to scan the product's QR code using my phone or computer camera,
So that I can instantly check if the product is authentic.

**Story Context:**
**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Camera APIs, QR decoding libraries, verification backend
- Technology: Web Camera API, React Native camera, QR parsing
- Follows pattern: Real-time camera scanning with instant feedback
- Touch points: Device camera, QR parsing, verification API

## Acceptance Criteria
**Functional Requirements:**
1. Web interface accesses device camera for QR scanning
2. Mobile app includes native camera integration for scanning
3. QR code detection and parsing happens in real-time
4. Scanned QR codes automatically trigger verification process

**Integration Requirements:**
5. Web Camera API works across browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox)
6. React Native camera integration works on iOS and Android
7. QR parsing handles various QR code formats and error correction

**Quality Requirements:**
8. Camera interface provides clear scanning guidelines
9. Scanning works in various lighting conditions
10. Fallback option for manual QR code data entry

## Tasks
- [ ] **Task 1:** Set up web camera integration for QR scanning
  - [ ] Implement Web Camera API with proper permissions handling
  - [ ] Add QR code detection library (jsqr or qr-scanner)
  - [ ] Create camera preview interface with scanning guidelines
  - [ ] Add browser compatibility handling for camera access

- [ ] **Task 2:** Build React Native mobile camera integration
  - [ ] Install and configure React Native camera library
  - [ ] Implement native camera integration for iOS and Android
  - [ ] Add QR code detection with real-time processing
  - [ ] Create camera overlay with scanning target area

- [ ] **Task 3:** Implement QR parsing and verification triggering
  - [ ] Add real-time QR code detection and parsing
  - [ ] Create automatic verification API call on successful scan
  - [ ] Implement error handling for malformed QR codes
  - [ ] Add visual feedback for successful scans

- [ ] **Task 4:** Create user-friendly scanning interface
  - [ ] Build scanning guidelines and instructions
  - [ ] Add manual QR code entry fallback option
  - [ ] Implement camera permission error handling
  - [ ] Create responsive design for various device sizes

## Dev Notes
**Technical Notes:**
- **Integration Approach:** Camera access → Real-time QR detection → Immediate parsing
- **Camera Pattern:** Progressive enhancement with permissions handling
- **Key Constraints:** Must work on both high-end and budget smartphones

## Testing
**Test Requirements:**
- Cross-browser camera access tests
- Mobile camera integration tests
- QR code parsing accuracy tests
- Various lighting condition tests
- Permission handling tests
- Fallback functionality tests

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Web QR scanning working across major browsers
- [ ] Mobile QR scanning integrated in React Native app
- [ ] Real-time QR detection with visual feedback
- [ ] Error handling for camera permissions and failures
- [ ] Manual entry fallback for QR scanning issues
- [ ] Cross-platform testing on various devices
