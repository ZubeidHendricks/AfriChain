# Story 4.4: Payment Status Tracking and Notifications

## Story
**User Story:**
As a user involved in a crypto-to-mobile money transaction,
I want real-time updates on my payment status,
So that I know when payments are confirmed and settlements are complete.

**Story Context:**
**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Payment processing, notification systems, status tracking
- Technology: SMS notifications, real-time updates, status dashboard
- Follows pattern: Event-driven status updates with notifications
- Touch points: Payment flow, SMS gateway, user dashboard

## Acceptance Criteria
**Functional Requirements:**
1. Real-time payment status updates (pending, confirmed, settled, failed)
2. SMS notifications for all major payment status changes
3. Payment history dashboard showing complete transaction timeline
4. Email notifications for settlement confirmations (optional)

**Integration Requirements:**
5. Event-driven architecture triggers status updates
6. SMS notifications via Africa's Talking API
7. Real-time dashboard updates via WebSocket or polling

**Quality Requirements:**
8. Status updates delivered within 30 seconds of events
9. SMS notifications delivered with 99% reliability
10. Payment history accessible for 12 months
