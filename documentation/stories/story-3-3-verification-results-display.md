# Story 3.3: Verification Results Display with Product History

## Story
**User Story:**
As a consumer who verified a product's authenticity,
I want to see detailed information about the product and artisan,
So that I can learn about the craft and make informed purchasing decisions.

**Story Context:**
**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Verification system (Story 3.2), product database, artisan profiles
- Technology: React components, product data aggregation
- Follows pattern: Rich information display with linked data
- Touch points: Product records, artisan profiles, verification history

## Acceptance Criteria
**Functional Requirements:**
1. Verification results show product name, description, and images
2. Artisan information including name, location, and craft specialization
3. Product creation date and blockchain minting timestamp
4. Previous verification attempts (without personal data)

**Integration Requirements:**
5. Product database queries aggregate all related information
6. Artisan profile data linked to product records
7. Verification history logged for analytics (privacy-compliant)

**Quality Requirements:**
8. Rich media display optimized for mobile and web
9. Loading states during data aggregation
10. Privacy protection for sensitive verification data

## Tasks
- [ ] **Task 1:** Build verification results display components
  - [ ] Create verification status display (authentic/counterfeit/unknown)
  - [ ] Build product information display with images and details
  - [ ] Add artisan profile display with location and specialization
  - [ ] Create blockchain certificate display with transaction details

- [ ] **Task 2:** Implement product data aggregation service
  - [ ] Create comprehensive product data retrieval service
  - [ ] Add artisan profile linking to product records
  - [ ] Implement verification history aggregation (privacy-compliant)
  - [ ] Add product creation and minting timestamp display

- [ ] **Task 3:** Create rich media and interactive elements
  - [ ] Build image gallery for product photos
  - [ ] Add interactive blockchain certificate viewer
  - [ ] Create artisan craft story display
  - [ ] Implement social sharing features for verified products

- [ ] **Task 4:** Add privacy controls and analytics tracking
  - [ ] Implement privacy-compliant verification logging
  - [ ] Add analytics tracking for verification patterns
  - [ ] Create verification history display (aggregate data only)
  - [ ] Add privacy controls for sensitive information

## Dev Notes
**Technical Notes:**
- **Integration Approach:** Verification success → Aggregate data → Rich display
- **Data Pattern:** Relational queries with privacy filtering
- **Key Constraints:** Must protect consumer and artisan privacy

## Testing
**Test Requirements:**
- Unit tests for data aggregation logic
- Privacy protection tests
- Rich media display tests
- Mobile responsiveness tests
- Loading state tests
- Analytics tracking tests

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Complete product information displayed after verification
- [ ] Artisan profiles linked and displayed appropriately
- [ ] Verification history shown without privacy violations
- [ ] Rich media display optimized for all devices
- [ ] Loading states provide smooth user experience
- [ ] Privacy controls protect sensitive information
