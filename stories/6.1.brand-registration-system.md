**zkSNARK Integration** [Source: docs/2-target-users.md]:
```python
# Zero-knowledge proof system for brand authenticity
class ZKProofService:
    def __init__(self):
        self.circom_circuit = "brand_verification.circom"
        self.trusted_setup = "setup_final.zkey"
    
    async def generate_brand_proof(self, brand_data: BrandData) -> ZKProof:
        """Generate zero-knowledge proof for brand authenticity"""
        # Create witness from brand verification data
        witness = {
            "business_reg_hash": hash(brand_data.business_registration),
            "trademark_hash": hash(brand_data.trademark_numbers),
            "verification_timestamp": int(time.time()),
            "admin_signature": brand_data.admin_verification_signature
        }
        
        # Generate proof without revealing sensitive data
        proof = await self.generate_proof(
            circuit=self.circom_circuit,
            witness=witness,
            proving_key=self.trusted_setup
        )
        
        # Store proof hash for verification
        await self.store_proof_hash(brand_data.brand_id, proof.hash)
        
        return proof
```

**Brand Protection System**:
- **Enhanced Detection**: Brand-specific rules with higher sensitivity for verified brands
- **Priority Alerts**: Immediate notifications to brand owners for suspected violations  
- **Automated Monitoring**: Continuous vector similarity search against official product catalog
- **Legal Integration**: Direct integration with takedown request systems for trademark violations

### Testing
- Unit tests for brand registration workflows
- Integration tests for brand verification process
- End-to-end tests for product submission
- Security tests for brand authentication
- UI/UX tests for registration portal
