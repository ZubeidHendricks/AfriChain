    rule_name VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,

```

**Enforcement Rule Configuration** [Source: docs/5-success-metrics.md]:
```python
# Default enforcement thresholds
ENFORCEMENT_RULES = {
    "luxury_goods": {
        "critical": {"score_range": (0, 20), "action": "immediate_takedown"},
        "high": {"score_range": (20, 40), "action": "pause_review"},
        "medium": {"score_range": (40, 65), "action": "visibility_reduce"},
        "low": {"score_range": (65, 85), "action": "warning_only"}
    },
    "electronics": {
        "critical": {"score_range": (0, 25), "action": "immediate_takedown"},
        "high": {"score_range": (25, 45), "action": "pause_review"},
        "medium": {"score_range": (45, 70), "action": "visibility_reduce"},
        "low": {"score_range": (70, 85), "action": "warning_only"}
    }
}
```

**Platform Integration Architecture**:
```python
# Abstract platform connector
class BasePlatformConnector(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    async def pause_product(self, product_id: str) -> PlatformResponse:
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    async def remove_product(self, product_id: str) -> PlatformResponse:
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    async def reduce_visibility(self, product_id: str, factor: float) -> PlatformResponse:
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    async def notify_supplier(self, supplier_id: str, message: str) -> PlatformResponse:
        pass

# Specific platform implementations
class ShopifyConnector(BasePlatformConnector):
    # Shopify Admin API integration
    pass

class WooCommerceConnector(BasePlatformConnector):
    # WooCommerce REST API integration
    pass
```

**Enforcement Action Workflow**:
1. **Trigger**: Rule engine violation from Story 3.2 triggers enforcement evaluation
2. **Rule Matching**: Match product score and category against enforcement rules
3. **Action Selection**: Select highest priority applicable action
4. **Approval Check**: Verify if human approval required for action
5. **Platform Execution**: Execute action via platform connector APIs
6. **Audit Logging**: Record complete action details and reasoning
7. **Supplier Notification**: Send automated notification to supplier
8. **Monitoring**: Track action completion and effectiveness

**API Endpoint Specifications** [Source: docs/architecture/api-specifications.md]:
```http
# Enforcement rule management
GET /api/v1/enforcement/rules?category=luxury_goods&active=true
POST /api/v1/enforcement/rules
PUT /api/v1/enforcement/rules/{rule_id}
DELETE /api/v1/enforcement/rules/{rule_id}

# Manual enforcement actions
POST /api/v1/enforcement/actions
{
    "product_id": "uuid",
    "action_type": "pause",
    "reason": "Manual review required",
    "override_rules": true
}

# Appeals management
GET /api/v1/enforcement/appeals?status=pending
POST /api/v1/enforcement/appeals/{action_id}/approve
POST /api/v1/enforcement/appeals/{action_id}/deny
```

**Supplier Reputation System**:
- **Reputation Score**: Calculated based on violation history and appeal success
- **Escalation Logic**: Repeat offenders face stricter enforcement thresholds
- **Whitelist Support**: Trusted suppliers with proven track records
- **Rehabilitation Path**: Suppliers can improve reputation through compliance

**Error Handling and Rollback**:
```python
# Enforcement action with rollback capability
class EnforcementTransaction:
    async def execute_action(self, action: EnforcementAction) -> ActionResult:
        try:
            # Execute platform API call
            platform_result = await self.platform_connector.execute(action)
            
            # Record successful action
            await self.audit_logger.log_success(action, platform_result)
            
            return ActionResult.success(platform_result)
        except PlatformAPIError as e:
            # Log failure and attempt rollback
            await self.audit_logger.log_failure(action, e)
            await self.rollback_action(action)
            
            return ActionResult.failure(e)
```

**Appeal and Override System**:
- **Supplier Appeals**: Self-service appeal submission with evidence upload
- **Admin Overrides**: Manual intervention with justification requirements
- **Review Workflow**: Multi-stage approval process for significant actions
- **False Positive Feedback**: Machine learning improvement from override data

**Performance and Scalability**:
- **Async Processing**: All enforcement actions executed asynchronously
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent overwhelming external platform APIs
- **Batch Processing**: Group similar actions for efficient execution
- **Circuit Breaker**: Fail-safe mechanisms for platform API outages

**Integration Points**:
- **Input**: Enforcement triggers from Rule Engine (Story 3.2)
- **Dependencies**: Product data (Story 2.1), analysis results (Story 3.1)
- **Output**: Status updates trigger notifications (Story 4.1)
- **Dashboard**: Action history displayed in admin interface (Story 5.1)
- **Analytics**: Enforcement effectiveness metrics (Story 5.2)

**Compliance and Regulatory Features**:
- **Audit Trail**: Complete immutable record of all enforcement actions
- **Regulatory Reporting**: Automated compliance reports for regulators
- **Data Retention**: Configurable retention policies for audit data
- **Geographic Rules**: Region-specific enforcement rules and thresholds

### Testing
- Unit tests for enforcement logic
- Integration tests for platform API calls
